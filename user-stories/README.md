# User Stories

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the ALX Airbnb project.

The file `user-stories.md` translates each use case into a user-centered story that outlines the goals and motivations of different system users, such as guests, hosts, admins, and payment systems.

These user stories serve as a foundation for further development, including feature planning and testing.
